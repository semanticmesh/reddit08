## Usage Instructions

Each installation chunk is designed to be self-contained and can be executed independently. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Execution**: Execute chunks in numerical order for first-time installation
2. **Independent Execution**: Each chunk can be run independently after a system restart
3. **Verification**: Each chunk includes verification steps to confirm successful completion
4. **Troubleshooting**: Each chunk includes common issues and solutions

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation process, ensure you have:
- Administrative access to the system
- Internet connection
- Sufficient disk space (at least 20GB free)
- Sufficient RAM (at least 8GB)

## Target Deployment Options

### Docker Deployment (Recommended for Production)
- Uses Docker and Docker Compose
- Containerized services
- Simplified management
- Consistent environments

### Local Development Setup (For Development)
- Direct system installation
- Detailed debugging capabilities
- Customizable development environment
- Faster iteration during development
