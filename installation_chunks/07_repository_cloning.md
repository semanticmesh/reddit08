# Installation Chunk 07: Repository Cloning

## Overview
This installation chunk clones the CRE Intelligence Platform repository to your local system.

## Prerequisites
- Git installation verification completed (Chunk 06)
- Internet connection

## Procedure

### 1. Navigate to Your Working Directory
Choose or create a directory where you want to clone the repository:
```bash
# Create a directory for your projects (if needed)
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects

# Or navigate to your preferred directory
cd /path/to/your/projects
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the CRE Intelligence Platform repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/reddit08.git
cd reddit08
```

If you have SSH keys configured (from Chunk 06):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-org/reddit08.git
cd reddit08
```

### 3. Verify Repository Structure
Check that the repository was cloned correctly:
```bash
ls -la
```

You should see files and directories including:
- `README.md`
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `requirements.txt`
- `src/` directory
- `scripts/` directory

### 4. Check Repository Status
Verify the Git status:
```bash
git status
```

Expected output: "On branch main" and "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

### 5. View Repository Information
Check the remote origin:
```bash
git remote -v
```

Expected output:
```
origin  https://github.com/your-org/reddit08.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-org/reddit08.git (push)
```

View repository information:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

### 6. Set Up Repository for Development
If you plan to contribute, set up your upstream branch:
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```

### 7. Verify Repository Integrity
Run a basic integrity check:
```bash
git fsck
```

Expected output: No errors or warnings

## Verification
After completing the above steps, you should have:
- [ ] Repository successfully cloned to your local system
- [ ] Correct directory structure verified
- [ ] Git status clean
- [ ] Remote origin configured correctly
- [ ] Repository integrity verified

## Troubleshooting
If cloning fails:

1. **Permission denied**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify repository URL is correct
   - If using SSH, ensure SSH keys are configured correctly

2. **Repository not found**:
   - Verify the repository URL
   - Check if you have access to the repository
   - Ensure the repository exists

3. **Slow download**:
   - Check your internet connection speed
   - Try cloning at a different time
   - Consider using a download accelerator

4. **Disk space issues**:
   - Check available disk space: `df -h`
   - Free up space if needed
