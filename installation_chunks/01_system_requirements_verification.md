# Installation Chunk 01: System Requirements Verification

## Overview
This installation chunk verifies that your system meets the minimum requirements for installing the CRE Intelligence Platform.

## Prerequisites
- Administrative access to the system for software installation

## Procedure

### 1. Verify Python Version
Check if Python 3.8 or higher is installed:
```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed or is below version 3.8:
- Download Python 3.8+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install with default settings

### 2. Verify Docker Installation (for Docker deployment)
Check if Docker is installed:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

If Docker is not installed:
- Download Docker Desktop for Windows/macOS from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- For Linux, follow the installation guide at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Minimum requirements:
- Docker Engine 20.10 or higher
- Docker Compose 1.29 or higher

### 3. Verify PostgreSQL Installation (for local development)
Check if PostgreSQL is installed:
```bash
psql --version
```

If PostgreSQL is not installed:
- Download PostgreSQL 12+ from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- Install with default settings

### 4. Verify Redis Installation (for local development)
Check if Redis is installed:
```bash
redis-server --version
```

If Redis is not installed:
- Download Redis 6.0+ from https://redis.io/download/
- Install with default settings

### 5. Verify Git Installation
Check if Git is installed:
```bash
git --version
```

If Git is not installed:
- Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Install with default settings

### 6. Verify System Resources
Ensure your system has:
- At least 8GB RAM
- At least 20GB free disk space

## Verification
After completing the above steps, you should have:
- [ ] Python 3.8 or higher installed
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed (if using Docker deployment)
- [ ] PostgreSQL installed (if using local development)
- [ ] Redis installed (if using local development)
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] Sufficient system resources (8GB+ RAM, 20GB+ free disk space)

## Next Steps
Proceed to the next installation chunk for either:
1. Docker installation and verification (if using Docker deployment)
2. Python virtual environment setup (if using local development)
